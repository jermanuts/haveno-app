## Prerequisites (For Testing)

Before you begin, you'll need to set up a testing environment:

- **Android Device or Emulator:** You can test on a physical Android phone or use an Android simulator via [Android Studio](https://studio.android.com) for advanced users. [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html) is another option with a gentler learning curve.
- **Latest Pre-release Builds:** Obtain the latest pre-release builds from the [Releases](https://github.com/KewbitXMR/haveno-app/releases) page. These are typically updated weekly.

**Important:** Follow the instructions in this guide carefully for Haveno Plus to function correctly.

## Setup Your Mobile Device

### Install Tor VPN Relay

To ensure all traffic is securely routed through Tor, you must install and activate a Tor VPN relay on your mobile device. The recommended apps are:

- **[Orbot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android):** Officially supported by The Tor Project.
  - [Sourcecode & Releases](https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot/releases/tag/17.3.2-RC-1-tor-0.4.8.12)
- **[InviZible](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pan.alexander.tordnscrypt.gp):** A popular community alternative.
  - [Sourcecode & Releases](https://github.com/Gedsh/InviZible/releases/tag/v2.3.0-beta)

**Steps:**
1. Download [Orbot on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.android) or [InviZible on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pan.alexander.tordnscrypt.gp).
   - Alternatively, download [InviZible on F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/pan.alexander.tordnscrypt.stable/).
2. Open the app of your choice and follow the on-screen instructions to activate it. Ensure that Tor is enabled and the VPN is activated.
3. Configure the VPN relay to route your Haveno Plus app traffic through Tor. The app will not load if a VPN relay is not configured first, by design, for your security.

### Haveno Install Guide

The Haveno Plus app is available as alpha pre-release builds for Android and Windows. Download the app from the [Releases](https://github.com/KewbitXMR/haveno-app/releases) page. The desktop clients are designed to be user-friendly, with custom installers for quick setup.

**Note:** Haveno Plus is currently configured to use the stagenet (a test network) for at least the next 2 months. It is not intended for real-life trading.
